# Jira API Migration Plan - JQL Search and Expression Evaluation Endpoints

## Overview

On **October 31, 2024**, Atlassian announced the deprecation of four critical Jira Cloud search APIs. These endpoints will be **removed on August 1, 2025** (updated from the original May 1, 2025 date).

## Deprecated Endpoints

The following endpoints will be removed:

1. **GET** `/rest/api/2|3|latest/search` - Search for issues using JQL (GET)
2. **POST** `/rest/api/2|3|latest/search` - Search for issues using JQL (POST)
3. **POST** `/rest/api/2|3|latest/search/id` - Search issue IDs using JQL
4. **POST** `/rest/api/2|3|latest/expression/eval` - Evaluate Jira expression

## New Replacement Endpoints

The deprecated APIs are being replaced with enhanced JQL service endpoints:

- **GET** `/rest/api/3/search/jql`
- **POST** `/rest/api/3/search/jql`

## Key Changes and Breaking Updates

### 1. Pagination Model Changes
- **Old**: Random page access with `startAt` and `maxResults` parameters
- **New**: Sequential pagination using "next page token" mechanism
- **Impact**: No more parallel requests or jumping to specific pages

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Response Time Improvements**:
  - P90 Elapsed Time: 209ms â†’ 144ms (31% improvement)
  - P99 Elapsed Time: 1502ms â†’ 358ms (76% improvement)

### 3. Request/Response Format Changes
- Enhanced JQL service uses different request structure
- Response format includes pagination tokens instead of traditional pagination metadata

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Assessment (Immediate) âœ…

1. **Inventory Current Usage**
   - [x] Audit all applications, scripts, and automations using deprecated endpoints
   - [x] Identify frequency of API calls and current pagination patterns
   - [x] Document all JQL queries currently in use

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - [x] Assess performance impact of sequential pagination requirement
   - [x] Identify code that relies on random page access
   - [x] Calculate potential changes to response times

### Phase 2: Development (Before June 1, 2025) âœ…

3. **Update API Calls**
   - [x] Replace deprecated endpoints with new enhanced JQL endpoints:
     ```
     OLD: GET /rest/api/3/search
     NEW: POST /rest/api/3/search/jql
     ```

4. **Implement New Pagination Logic**
   - [x] Replace `startAt`/`maxResults` pagination with token-based pagination
   - [x] Update code to handle sequential page traversal
   - [x] Implement pagination token storage and management
   - [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing offset-based calls

5. **Optimize Query Strategy**
   - [x] Support configurable batch sizes up to 5,000 issues per call
   - [x] Maintain existing field selection behavior
   - [x] Preserve existing single-phase approach for compatibility
   - Note: Two-phase optimization can be implemented later if needed

6. **Update Expression Evaluation**
   - [x] No expression evaluation endpoints were found in current codebase
   - [x] Migration focused on search endpoints only

### Phase 3: Testing (June - July 2025) âœ…

7. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - [x] Test pagination across different scenarios (token-based and backward compatibility)
   - [x] Validate API request structure with new POST endpoints
   - [x] Test error handling for malformed JQL and authentication errors
   - [x] Verify all use cases work with new endpoints through automated tests

8. **Performance Validation**
   - [x] Validate request structure matches new JQL endpoint requirements
   - [x] Confirm proper handling of fields, limits, and pagination parameters
   - [x] Test integration with existing caching and image fetching logic

### Phase 4: Deployment (Before August 1, 2025) ðŸš€

9. **Production Deployment**
   - [x] Code ready for deployment with migrated endpoints
   - [ ] Deploy updated plugin version to Obsidian Community Plugin marketplace
   - [ ] Monitor API call success rates after release
   - [ ] Track performance improvements with new endpoints
   - [ ] Set up user feedback monitoring

10. **Cleanup**
    - [x] Updated all endpoint references to new JQL API
    - [x] Updated technical documentation and migration plan
    - [x] Maintained backward compatibility - no old logic to archive

## Best Practices for Migration

### Query Optimization
- Use the most restrictive JQL possible to minimize result sets
- Prefer project-scoped JQLs over global searches
- Use issue IDs instead of keys when possible for better performance

### Error Handling
- Implement robust retry logic for pagination token failures
- Handle cases where pagination tokens expire
- Add fallback mechanisms for large dataset processing

### Performance Considerations
- **For Large Datasets**: Use the two-phase approach (IDs first, then bulk fetch)
- **For Real-time Applications**: Consider caching strategies
- **For Parallel Processing**: Batch issue retrieval after ID collection

## Code Examples

### Old Pagination Pattern
```javascript
// OLD - Random page access
const getIssues = async (startAt = 0, maxResults = 50) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/rest/api/3/search?jql=${jql}&startAt=${startAt}&maxResults=${maxResults}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

### New Sequential Pagination Pattern
```javascript
// NEW - Token-based sequential pagination
const getAllIssues = async (jql) => {
  let allIssues = [];
  let token = null;
  
  do {
    const url = `/rest/api/3/search/jql${token ? `?token=${token}` : ''}`;
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ jql, maxResults: 5000 })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    allIssues.push(...data.issues);
    token = data.nextPageToken;
  } while (token);
  
  return allIssues;
};
```

## Timeline Summary

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| October 31, 2024 | Deprecation announcement |
| June 1, 2025 | **Recommended completion of development** |
| July 31, 2025 | **Final testing deadline** |
| August 1, 2025 | **Endpoints removed - HARD DEADLINE** |

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Application Downtime**: Apps not migrated by August 1, 2025 will break
2. **Performance Degradation**: Sequential pagination may slow down some operations
3. **Data Access Issues**: Large datasets may require significant architecture changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start migration immediately
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Consider alternative data access patterns for large datasets
- Have rollback plans for performance issues
